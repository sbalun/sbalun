- 👋 Hi, I’m Scott
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming better at programming because it is a skill I can leverage to improve software quality.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with Java and JavaScript. I'm also interested in python 🐍 and datascience and I'd love to create an iOS app one day! Swift anyone? 😀
- 💡 The best way to get better at anything in life is by practicing. Coding fluency is no different.  There are no short-cuts.
- 🎶 When not testing software you'll find me working as a performing musician playing 4 & 5 string electric bass guitar and stand-up bass
- 🕰 Too little time and so much to learn. I'll do my best! 🙂
