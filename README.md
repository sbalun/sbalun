- 👋 Hi, I’m Scott
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming better at coding because it is a skill I can leverage to improve my ability to test software
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java ☕️ but I'm also very interested in Python 🐍 and data science 🔬.  JavaScript and Swift are next!
- 💡 The best way to get better at coding is by coding.  There is no way around that fact.
- 🎶 When not testing software you'll find me working as a performing musician playing 4 & 5 string electric bass guitar and stand-up bass
- 🕰 Too little time and so much to learn. I'll do my best! 🙂
