- 👋 Hi, I’m Scott
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming better at programming because it is a skill I can leverage to improve software quality.
- 🌱 I’m currently working mostly with Java ☕️ but I'm also interested in Python 🐍 and data science.  JavaScript and Swift are up next on my CE journey.
- 💡 The best way to get better at anything in life including coding is by practicing. There is no way around that fact.  There are no short-cuts.
- 🎶 When not testing software you'll find me working as a performing musician playing 4 & 5 string electric bass guitar and stand-up bass
- 🕰 Too little time and so much to learn. I'll do my best! 🙂
